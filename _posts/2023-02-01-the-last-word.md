The year is 2023.

The USA has just recovered   
from a deadly virus that  
killed over 1 million people.  

The economy is near collapse.  
Food Prices have spiraled  
out of control.

citizens with an iron fist.  

Corporations are wealthier and more powerful than ever,  
locked in endless struggle with hackers for dominance.  

But only one group will get  
The Last Word...
