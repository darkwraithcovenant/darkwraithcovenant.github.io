title:  Design Approach

I wanted to design the DWC Corporate webpage based on the design principles found in 1990s era operating systems like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows 95 and 98. As for the blog, I was inspired by the underground tech/geek/hacker scene of the past and present. I love the minimalist, early internet designs that many in the underground maker/hacker scene still use. 

The aim was for both the blog and the corporate page to evoke a time where the limited screen resolutions and colors were quite limiting. Microsoft was beginning to set themselves aside as the more corporate friendly brand compared to Apple‚Äôs academic, artist and musician friendly platform.

#### Background

One of my first IT jobs was installing Windows 98 from a CD-ROM at a family member‚Äôs workplace, which happened to be a law office. I think this was technically illegal (dear lawyers, never change), but back then I imagine many were either ignorant of things such as ‚Äúlicensing,‚Äù or they simply didn‚Äôt care. As a teenager fresh out of high school, I was cheaper than hiring a consultant.

The Launch of Windows 98 was absolutely üî•

I don‚Äôt even think they ever paid me for the job, which was to simply install windows 98 on several computers with one CD-Key. This was before Volume Licensing and online activations. They simply trusted that you couldn‚Äôt get a key. (You could get a key). The stodgy corpos in the ‚Äúbusiness community‚Äù had adopted computers in the workplace early on, conjuring visions of 1980s films filled with confused men working in cubicles typing on big chunky keyboards, staring at amber monochrome CRTs.

Let's just ignore the creepy implications of the love story of this film...

But by this time we were far past that reality, light years ahead in comparison to the Amiga, the Commodore, or the Atari ST.

In the late 1990s the World Wide Web exploding exponentially, and Windows began to reflect the magnitude of this explosion by incorporating Internet Explorer directly into the GUI. This decision would irritate users who liked Win95‚Äôs simplicity and smaller size. The biggest sticking point was the $80 pricetag for Win98, which many could not justify for an upgrade that ostensibly didn‚Äôt look very different. In fact, Internet Explorer was actually a paid add-on for Win95! This shotgun wedding between IE and the Windows environment is still visible in Windows 10/11‚Äôs Explorer.exe today, with its browser-esque navigation interface that revolutionized the way we read/write/access files.
