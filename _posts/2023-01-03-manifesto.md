#### Why the internet is unbearable now.

The way we consumed the social internet was much different when I first started learning HTML. It was a lot more democratic than it is today. It was more decentralized, and mega corporations had not yet taken advantage of your eyes and flooded them with ads at the torrential levels they do today. *insert quote from no logo*.   

As usual, companies that serve and sell ads creeped in. They became pervasive and downright malicious in their relentless quest for more engagement, more clicks, more buys, and more revenue. They began to use data taken from us in unscrupulous ways, and rather than promote hateful ideas themselves, allowed people who spread hateful ideas to feature those ads on their content. Trump was given billions in free marketing in the 2016 election cycle, in exchange for your eyes and attention, so that ads could be served to you on the channels that showed his face and his ideas 24/7. And that was just legacy media on TV, what was happening with facebook and Cambridge Analytica was even more alarming. 

The internet used to be for us and by us - the nerds, the geeks, the punks, the outsiders. Before social media, we had webrings. It was much easier to find content relevant to our interests, being served by people who actually cared about those interests. Mistakes were certainly made, and content moderation was poor a lot of times where it mattered. But most pages were static and allowed very little interaction.

 A lot of hateful toxic behavior was allowed to go unchecked on Web 1.0, with too many moderators and admins naively believing that non-meatspace interaction was not real life. We've made strides to protect the vulnerable and oppressed, though not without vicious backlash from those with no interest in making the internet a better place for everyone.

We've stopped walking down the street in a metaphorical big open world (wide web), enjoying all the parks, nature, restaurants, bars, music venues, and schools. Instead we have stayed in one single massive, towering megabuilding, riding an elevator up and down floors. With each new floor, social media sites serve you the content they think you want to see, making you forget at once that you're in the same building, owned by one company who doesn't care about your well being. The fact that you go to 3-4 different buildings - facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, etc. - is the illusion of choice. You are no longer are walking the town square, in a wide world of town squares each with unique offerings. How utterly dull! Why have we done this to ourselves?

The world wide web used to be more like     
this: [][][][][][],   
but today it's more like  
this: <br>
[]  
[]  
[]

Siloed, curated by someone else, for your undivided attention. Just look at how instagram and tiktok serve content. It's an endless scroll, hacking your dopaminurgic system to ultimately sell ads. They won't even let you multitask, this addictive behavior is built in. 

But there is a better way, and like the era of geocities and angelfire, the latter of which I still have my original account I made in 1997 with, it is what we build it to be. We can learn from previous mistakes. We can understand what went wrong, and correct it. Or we could continue to languish in forever scrolling hell. What of we thought of each of our personal webpages as the "Post" part of social media. We can still have our square designs, but the customization is what makes the old web so special. A webpage is an expression of the self, one bit of code at a time. Why then, have we let someone else do all the heavy lifting? Social media sites have their place. But we still have the option of creating out own pages, and we shoul all be taking advantage of that.

This is why I support the Yesterweb movement, which you can read more about here: []()
