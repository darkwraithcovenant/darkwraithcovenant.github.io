<h2> Darkwraith Covenant Industries Incorporated</h2>
<p> 🗡️🗡️🗡️Darkwraith Covenant Industries Inc. is a name that strikes fear and awe into the hearts of many, and for good reason. We are a Misfortune 500 company based out of the Silicon Forest🌲 in Portland, OR, specializing in the dark arts of Occultism⛧ and Paramilitary🪖 Defense🚀. Our divisions are dedicated to the advancement of heavy industry🏭, noise research🔊, video production🎥, and propaganda dissemination📺. We have a great many tools in our arsenal to ensure that the dark powers☠️ behind us are always given the upper hand🫴🏽.</p>

<p> From our Electronic Signals Intelligence📡, Psychotronic Warfare🧠, and Aural Weapons Research🔇 divisions, we seek out the most advanced, cutting-edge technology and weaponry to dominate the battlefield☢️ and conquer our enemies☣️. Our Agitprop and Subliminal Messaging📰 programs are also used to spread disinformation🥸 and propaganda🗞️, so that our opponents are never fully aware of the true extent of our power.</p>

<p> But we are also a company that cares, and while our Board of Directors may be heavily invested in the suffering of marginalized people in the Global South🌍, we also strive to do what we can to produce clothing products as ethically as possible👕. Darkwraith Covenant is committed to ensuring that our products are made with the utmost care and respect for those who use them.</p>

<p> Nevertheless, Darkwraith Covenant is a force to be reckoned with. Our advanced technology, combined with our will to succeed, will continue to drive our success for years to come.🗡️🗡️🗡️</p>
