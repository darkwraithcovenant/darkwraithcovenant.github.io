Darkwraith Covenant is an open source art project by Jose De Lara of Portland, OR. My intent in this blog I will be to catalog just about every part of my creative process with as much transparency as possible. I am inspired by the open source software movement, and copyleft. All creations will be open source and reusable (with the Creative Commons license). In character posts by Darkwraith Covenant Industries (DWCII)Incorporated are marked by three dagger emojis: 🗡️🗡️🗡️

I'm currently teaching myself web development via Jeckyll and soon React when I start to create the dynamic elements of my faux dystopian windows desktop, which will tie into the current fictional narrative of DWCII.
